# halo-trainer

This project is used as an example of some of the capabilities of the nouzuru
memory manipulation framework. It employs memory patching techniques,
continuous freezing of values (re-writing memory every few milliseconds), as
well as value tracking of in-game structures, such as the Master Chief data
structure.
